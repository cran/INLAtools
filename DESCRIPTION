Description: Contain code to work with latent Gaussian
  Markov random field (GMRF) models. Queries for the 
  'cgeneric' interface, specified as a way to implement
  new GMRF models to be fitted as model components
  in the 'INLA' package (<https://www.r-inla.org>).
  The implemented functionalities leverage the use 
  of 'cgeneric' models and provide a way to debug 
  the code as well to work with the prior for the 
  model parameters and to sample from it. 
  A Kronecker product method is also implemented to 
  work with the four possible combinations between 
  a 'cgeneric' and a 'rgeneric' model.
